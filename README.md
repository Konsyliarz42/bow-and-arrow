# ![bow]![arrow] Bow and arrow

The default arrows and bow are very ugly. \
So I have created a prettier version.

## Version 2.0.0

All textures have been redesigned, so all additional features have been **removed** and will (probably) be added back soon.

## FAQ

### Which versions of Minecraft work with this resource pack?

I have tested the package with all versions from 1.18.2 to 1.21.10 and they work. \
The other versions have not been tested.

### Will version 1.x.x continue?

I have no plans for it.
