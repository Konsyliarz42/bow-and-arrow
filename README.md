# Bow and arrow

The default arrows and bow are very ugly.  
So I have created a prettier version.

## Additional Feature

> CIT Resewn or Optifine is **required**!

### Quiver

*If you have a lot of arrows, use quiver!*

The quiver is automatically used when a player has at least 8 arrows.

> **Optifine** does not match textures for tipped arrows so **whole** quiver change colour!

## Recommendation mods

### [CIT Resewn](https://modrinth.com/mod/cit-resewn)

*Re-implements MCPatcher's CIT (custom item textures from optifine resource packs)* - from modrith page

### [Sprite Arrows](https://modrinth.com/mod/sprite-arrows)

*Renders Arrows as their Item Model, did you know that Tridents are arrows?* - from modrinth page
