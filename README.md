# Bow and arrow

The default arrows and bow are very ugly.  
So I have created a prettier version.

## Additional Feature

> CIT Resewn or Optifine is **required**!

### Quiver

*If you have a lot of arrows, use quiver!*

The quiver is automatically used when a player has at least 8 arrows.

> **Optifine** does not match textures for tipped arrows so **whole** quiver change colour!

### Short bow

*Not just for kids!*

A new type of bow inspired by Minecraft Dungeons.  
Add "short bow" to the bow name to get a small weapon.

### Long bow

*When you need something bigger!*

A new type of bow inspired by Minecraft Dungeons.  
Add "long bow to the name of the bow to get this large piece of wood.

### Material bows

*Show everyone how epic your bow is!*

You can change the material of your bow.  
Use the anvil to rename your bow from the list below:

- Diamond:
    - Diamond short bow
    - Diamond bow
    - Diamond long bow
- Gold:
    - Golden short bow
    - Golden bow
    - Golden long bow
- Iron:
    - Iron short bow
    - Iron bow
    - Iron long bow
- Netherite:
    - Netherite short bow
    - Netherite bow
    - Netherite long bow
