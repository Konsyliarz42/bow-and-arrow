# ![bow]![arrow] Bow and arrow

The default arrows and bow are very ugly.  
So I have created a prettier version.

## ![bow] Additional Features

> [CIT Resewn] **required**!

### ![quiver] Quiver

_If you have a lot of arrows, use quiver!_

The quiver is automatically used when a player has at least 8 arrows.

### ![short_bow] Short bow

_Not just for kids!_

A new type of bow inspired by Minecraft Dungeons.  
Add "short bow" to the bow name to get a small weapon.

### ![recurve_bow] Recurve bow

_What a style!_

A new type of bow developed for [MedievalWeapons].  
Add "recurve bow" to the bow name to get this elegant weapon.

### ![long_bow] Long bow

_When you need something bigger!_

A new type of bow inspired by Minecraft Dungeons.  
Add "long bow to the name of the bow to get this large piece of wood.

### Material bows

_Show everyone how epic your bow is!_

You can change the material of your bow.  
Use the anvil to rename your bow with material(_header_) and bow type(_first column_):

|             |                | Iron                | Golden                | Diamond                | Netherite                |

## FAQ

### Why OptiFine is not supported?

Optifine has a lot of bugs and many features don't work, for example tiped quivers or long bows.
If you really want to work with optifine, go ahead and create a pull request with fixes for my package.

### Which versions of Minecraft work with this resource pack?

I have tested the package with all versions from 1.18.2 to 1.21.1 and they work.
The other versions have not been tested.
