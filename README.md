# Bow and arrow

The default arrows and bow are very ugly.  
So I have created a prettier version.

## FAQ

### Why will OptiFine not be supported?

Optifine has a lot of bugs and many features don't work, for example tip quivers or long bows.
If you really want to work with optifine, go ahead and create a pull request with fixes for my package.

### Which versions of Minecraft work with this resource pack?

I have tested the package with all versions from 1.18.2 to 1.20.1 and they work.
The other versions have not been tested.
