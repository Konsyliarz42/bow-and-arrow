# Bow and arrow

The default arrows and bow are very ugly.  
So I have created a prettier version.

## Additional Feature

> CIT Resewn or Optifine is **required**!

### Quiver

*If you have a lot of arrows, use quiver!*

The quiver is automatically used when a player has at least 8 arrows.

> **Optifine** does not match textures for tipped arrows so **whole** quiver change colour!

### Material bows

*Show everyone how epic your bow is!*

You can change the material of your bow.  
Use the anvil to rename your bow from the list below:

- Diamond - Diamond bow
- gold - Golden bow
- Iron - Iron bow
- Netherite - Netherite bow
