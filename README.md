# ![bow]![arrow] Bow and arrow

The default arrows and bow are very ugly. \
So I have created a prettier version.

## Additional features

> **Important** \
> [CIT Resewn](https://modrinth.com/mod/cit-resewn) is required.

### ![quiver] Quiver

_If you have a lot of arrows, use quiver!_

The quiver is automatically used when a player has at least 16 arrows. \
Each type of arrows has its own texture.

## FAQ

### Which versions of Minecraft work with this resource pack?

I have tested the package with all versions from 1.18.2 to 1.21.10 and they work. \
The other versions have not been tested.

### Will version 1.x.x continue?

I have no plans for it.

### Why were the old additional features removed?

Since version 2.0.0, I have prepared a new bow model \
and do not have time to prepare fixes for all variants.
